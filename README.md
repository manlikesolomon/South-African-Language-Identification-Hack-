# Language Classification in South Africa

## Introduction
This notebook focuses on training a classification model to predict the language of a given text in South Africa. With its linguistic diversity and 11 official languages, including Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, and more, accurately identifying the language of a text is crucial for many applications. This project aims to automate language detection, which can be valuable for tasks like customer support language routing or content filtering.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of text samples labeled with their corresponding South African language. The text samples encompass a variety of topics and come from diverse sources. The dataset has been preprocessed and is ready for use in training the classification model.

## Methodology
The classification model will be built using machine learning techniques. We will employ a supervised learning approach, utilizing a labeled dataset to train the model. The notebook will cover several steps, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Implementation
The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on data loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction. It then proceeds to train and evaluate various classification models using techniques such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes. Each model will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics and compared to determine the most effective approach.

## Results and Conclusion
The performance of each model will be analyzed and presented in the notebook. The classification model achieving the highest accuracy and precision will be identified as the most suitable for language classification in the South African context. Finally, conclusions and recommendations for further improvement or expansion of the model will be provided.

By the end of this notebook, we will have developed a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting the language of a given text in South Africa.
